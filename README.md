This was my first university project, developed for an introductory software development course. The task was to create a simple game as a console application using only basic programming constructs such as arrays, loops, conditionals, and functions.
Project Overview

  Console-Based Gameplay: Fully text-based game running in the terminal.
  Core Logic with Basics: Built using fundamental programming tools â€” no advanced libraries or external frameworks. Even lists are prohibited
  Custom Mechanics: Game logic designed from scratch with a focus on problem-solving and code structure.

Key Concepts Practiced:

  Arrays and loops
  Conditional statements
  Simple function design
  Basic input/output handling
  Game flow control

Purpose:

This project aimed to strengthen foundational programming skills and introduce logical thinking through a hands-on "game development" assignment.
